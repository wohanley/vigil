# Vigil

A video game about checking your phone.

## How to play

Imagine you and your opponent live in houses on opposite sides of a large field. The field takes some amount of time to cross. Now imagine you and your opponent have both baked pies. You each want to sneak across the field and eat the other's pie. If you can make it to your opponent's house, you can eat their pie and win. If your opponent looks out the window and spots you sneaking over, then they win.

That's a limited metaphor for the game. More simply put, the mechanics are as follows:
- If you're alive, you can attack any other player in the game.
- Attacks take a certain amount of time, configurable when the game starts.
- If a player you're attacking refreshes their game before your attack is over, you die.
- If the player you're attacking doesn't refresh their game for the entire duration of your attack, they die.

There is an obvious winning strategy - just keep watching your game! But in practice, our attention drifts...
